# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata is a fork of the original ["Gilded Rose Kata"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) with only the C# Core version in it.
It is done using TDD development to ensure the code is working during the rafctoring process.

## Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 6 Framework
- C# 10
